# Lecture Notes: Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Introduction
In this lecture, we’ll explore how Test-Driven Development (TDD) informs unit testing, where tests are written first. The typical TDD process includes writing unit tests that fail initially because the corresponding code hasn't been implemented yet. The code is then written and refactored to pass these tests. This ensures a well-tested codebase, helping catch errors early and making debugging easier over time.

## Task Overview
1. Set up the project and unit tests using TDD principles.
2. Write unit tests for specific parts of the code.
3. Refactor code to ensure it's clean and maintainable.
4. Automate the execution of tests using hooks (e.g., with Linter or Prettier).
5. Push the code to GitHub.
6. Deploy the app and verify all tests are green (passing).

## Benefits of TDD and Unit Testing

- **Fewer Errors in Production**: TDD helps catch issues early, leading to fewer bugs in production.
- **Team Collaboration**: In large teams, tests provide visibility and help pinpoint problems faster.
- **Reliable Codebase**: When all tests pass, you can have greater confidence in the stability of your code.
- **Best Practices**: TDD promotes writing clean, maintainable code by enforcing regular refactoring.

## Potential Pitfalls

- **Inconsistent Testing**: It’s easy to forget to run tests, or write tests that are too generic to capture real issues.
- **Too Many Trivial Tests**: Writing trivial or redundant tests can clutter the codebase without providing value.
- **Lack of Standardization**: In larger teams, inconsistent approaches to unit testing can cause confusion.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing involves testing isolated pieces of code like functions, modules, or classes. Each test ensures that the unit of code behaves as expected. When testing isolated components, you can confidently integrate them into larger systems knowing they work correctly.

## Trivial Unit Tests Included
The repository includes trivial examples of unit tests for the following types of functionality:
- **Arrays**
- **Asynchronous Functions**
- **Exceptions**
- **Numbers**
- **Objects**
- **Promises**
- **Strings**
- **Sums**
- **Truthiness**

These examples demonstrate the basic usage of Jest for different types of data and scenarios that are common in everyday programming.

## Tools for Unit Testing

### Popular Unit Testing Frameworks:
- **Jasmine**: A tool for testing both UI and backend code, with a syntax similar to JavaScript.
- **Mocha.js**: A reliable tool for running tests, especially useful in Chrome, for both frontend and backend environments.
- **Cypress**: While more powerful, it can be overkill for simple unit tests but works well for both frontend and backend tests.
- **Jest**: The tool used in this repository. It is widely adopted due to its simplicity, excellent documentation, and live snapshot testing.

Unit testing and TDD bring many benefits, especially in large projects or teams. Although writing tests can take additional time upfront, it ensures the reliability of your code and helps catch issues early. Tools like Jest make integrating testing into your development process straightforward, allowing you to write better, more maintainable software over time.
